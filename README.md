Resources for [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock), [AdNauseam](https://github.com/dhowe/adnauseam),  [uMatrix](https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/): static filter lists, ready-to-use rulesets, etc.

The goal of this repository is to receive all the reports for the need of new filters, or reports of web pages broken by existing filters, and will be open for people to contribute (those who have proven to be valuable contributors will be given write permissions on the project). Ideally I wish eventually there will be a small army of volunteers dedicated to deal with filter issues.

The rationale on whether to include a specific filter in one of uBO's own filter lists is the same as outlined by [EasyList/EasyPrivacy policies](https://easylist.to/pages/policy.html), also taking into account whether a filter requires uBO's extended filter syntax.
