        To avoid burdening volunteers with invalid issues:
        - Do not use another content blocker along uBO:
            - You need to verify that the issue still occurs when using only uBO.
            - Some browsers have a built-in content blocker, which may be causing the issue.
        - Using too many filter lists increases likelihood of filter issues on websites.
            - You may be asked to verify that the issue still occurs when using only default filter lists.
