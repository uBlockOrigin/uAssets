# uBlock Origin -- Privacy filters
#
# Some of these filters make use of the `important` filter option,
# which purpose is to guarantee that a filter won't be overriden by 
# exception filters.
#
# I will use data from benchmarks to decide what to add here.

# I think web sites can live without this
# Commented out on 2014-10-03: I don't see it anymore in benchmarks. Will see.
# Commenting it out allows me to enable this one out-of-the-box.

# Commented out, breaks to many sites. See:

#   Users can still block this one through hpHosts, MVPS, Dan Pollock's or
#   manually through custom filters, or 3rd-party scripts

! gravity.com, essentially just like Taboola, Outbrain.
! Creates "recommended" click-baity links which point back to their servers,
! meaning that as a 3rd-party, this increases the privacy exposure of visitors.
! Will starts with narrower filters, will broaden if required while keeping
! this 3rd-party under watch.
! Example site using it: http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/
||rma-api.gravity.com/*/api/intelligence
||api.gravity.com/*/recommendations
||b.grvcdn.com/moth-min.js
! The following filters are the ssl counterparts of the ones above. They were
! spotted on: https://techcrunch.com/
! The links were not click-baity, they APPEARED to be just 1st-party links.
! However, clicking on any of these links caused the browser to visit 3rd-party
! rma-api.gravity.com before being redirected back to the expected 1st-party
! content.
